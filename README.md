# First Landing

## Purpose 
FirstLanding is a landing page that showcases my other landing pages. This project helps me practice styling, design, and experimenting with new technologies like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. Itâ€™s named "FirstLanding" as it represents one of my first landing page projects, inspired by the first moon landing. My goal is to create a new landing page every week.
